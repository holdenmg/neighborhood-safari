  ## Usage
 
 On the homepage all posts of sightings are visible, and are clearly marked if dangerous, missing, or endangered. If logged in you can post ocmments on other users' posts. On your dashboard you can create a new post. This process will direct you to choose an animal and provide some details of the sighting. You will also have the option to mark the animal as a missing pet, or a potential danger. When the post is created it will appear on your dashboard page. Post details can be updated from the dashboard. When viewing a post, the title can be clicked to link to natureserve.org for more information on that particular species. 

### Get Involved
Neighborhood Safari thrives on community participation. You can contribute by:
- Creating spotting posts about animals you've encountered.
- Sharing your knowledge about animals to help others understand their behaviors.
- Keeping an eye out for missing pet alerts and assisting in reuniting pets with their owners.
- Providing feedback to improve the platform and make it even more useful for everyone.
Let's work together to create a hub where wildlife enthusiasts, pet lovers, and concerned citizens can connect and engage with the nature around them. Happy exploring!
